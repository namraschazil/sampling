## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    1.	The survey aims to capture the diverse perspectives on how music taste evolves with age and other influencing factors. It analyzes the individual experiences and broader trends related to the sociology of music taste both by qualitative and quantitative analysis. 
    The sample for this survey is obtained through stratified random sampling approach. The sample seems to be representative of the target population which in this case are the people residing in Toronto between the ages of 18-50 years old. Stratified sampling divides the sampling frame (Toronto residents who also have a valid email address to be contacted) into different stratum like age, profession, general interests and then employed simple random sampling within each strata to get the desired sample. There are some considerations though as the sample might be potentially biased. This is because it could favour respondents who are more interest in music and musical instruments that people who don‚Äôt have similar interests. Depending on the mode of distribution of the survey eg email in this case, there could be a challenge in reaching diverse age range, particularly older adults who might not use their email that often compared to younger people. Other factors like cultural background, geographical location, and socioeconomical status also play a role in determining the interest of people into music or musical instruments.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    2.	I would make a few changes to my list of questions which are as follow:
    
    1.	What is your age range (in years)? 
    A.	18-25 
    B.	25-35 
    C.	35-45
    D.	45-50
    (I have included multiple choice question so people can select which age range they fall into easily and specifically. The options will also make it easier for the data to be analyzed later. Also avoiding double barrel question by asking age and profession in the same question)
    
    2.	Please specify your gender?
    A.	Male
    B.	Female
    C.	Non-binary
    D.	Prefer not to answer
    (included this question to get a better idea of the demographics of the population)
    
    3.	What is your educational background?
    A.	High school diploma
    B.	Bachelors degree
    C.	Masters degree
    D.	Other (please fill in)
    (changing the question about profession to educational background makes it a close ended question and giving multiple choice makes it easier for people to answer and minimises variance in the answers.)
    
    4.	How often do you play a musical instrument?
    A.	Rarely or never
    B.	Occasionally (1-3 days per week)
    C.	Regularly (4-6 days per week)
    D.	Daily 
    (the question gives a forced choice to participants so they can record their choice instead of just giving a yes or no answer to if they play an instrument. This will give more data to analyse at end)
    
    5.	How often do you listen to music?
    A.	Rarely or never
    B.	Occasionally (1-3 days per week)
    C.	Regularly (4-6 days per week)
    D.	Daily 
    (the question gives a forced choice to participants so they can record their choice instead of just giving a yes or no answer to if they listen to music. This will give more data to analyse at end)
    
    6.	What kind of music do you generally listen to? 
    A.	Rock
    B.	Jazz
    C.	Pop
    D.	Classical
    E.	Heavy metal
    F.	Country
    G.	Folk
    H.	Soul
    I.	Other (please specify)
    (better to rephrase the question to include the different kinds of music genres)
    
    7.	How much has your music choice changed over the course of the years?
    A.	Very different to before
    B.	Somewhat similar to before
    C.	Not changed at all
    D.	Don‚Äôt listen to music 
    (Instead of asking ‚Äò Have you always listened to the same kind of music?‚Äô, I changed the wording so people can be more clear in their response and could have more options  eg for people whose music taste hasnt changed a lot but also isn‚Äôt exactly the same)
    
    8.	How would you describe your perception of current popular music trends?
    A.	Very positive
    B.	Somewhat positive
    C.	Neutral
    D.	Somewhat negative
    E.	Very negative
    (Included this question to get an idea of the general music perception of people.)
    9.	Do you think your age has influenced your music taste? If yes, in what ways?
    
    (instead of asking ‚ÄúDid you listen to a genre of music in the past that you don‚Äôt listen to anymore?, I have rephrased the questioned so it is more subtle open-ended and doesn‚Äôt expect extreme answers like yes or no but rather encourages participant to express their change in music taste over the years so theat we can have a healthy qualitative analysis.)
    
    10.	Reflecting on your life so far, how do you think music has impacted different stages of your life (childhood, adolescence, adulthood)
    (rephrased this open-ended question ‚ÄúDo you listen to different music depending on your mood?‚Äù so that it can allow the participant to reflect on the changes of their music taste depending on their age.)
    
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    3.	An observational study might have been useful for this study to some extent for example the use of apps like youtube music or spotify to study the relationship between age of participant (account user) and genres of music that they mostly listened to. It wouldn‚Äôt however have given a full analysis of one person‚Äôs life and how their music taste has change dover the years because the different stages in their lives would be quite far apart (childhood, adolesent) and the app might not have data of that. They might be listening to music in their childhood, but the technology might be different then and they might not have application user account which had stored data of their music preferences.  Moreover, one app and user account could be used by more than one person and so the songs they listen to would not just be for them but they could play it for friends, family etc so it can‚Äôt be indicative of solely their own music taste. Furthermore, not everyone who listens to music has a phone or application and they can have other sources like old school radio, cds etc so it would be difficult to include those people in the observational study.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
