1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.

### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

The purpose of the survey is to find the relationship between music taste and age as the former relates to perception of music taste. One part of the survey will try to find a relation between individuals of different ages and their music taste while the other part of the survey will focus on the comparison between music taste of an individual during various stages of his life. 

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```

```
Target population:
People residing in Toronto between the ages of 18-50 years of age.

Sampling frame:
Toronto residents who have a valid email address and are aged 18-50 and will be contacted randomly through their email address to complete the survey.

Sampling units:
An individual between the ages of 18-50 years

Sampling strategy:
Simple random sampling- anyone aged 18-50 years with a valid email address will be listed and will be randomly contacted through their email address. edited after feedback : A better approach to sampling could be stratified sampling as we could make stratas based on our population so in this case age, profession, interests etc and then so random samoling within those strata to get a better picture of the sample.

```
1. write your question here...
