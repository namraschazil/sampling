| Weights                    | Estimation weights and bootstrap weights were used. Basic weighting factor was used for estimating the number of persons having one or several given characteristics. Bootstrapped eights were created for the purpose of design-based variance estimation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     Weight have been created for the dataset using the raking process: marginal values were successfully weighted according to province as well as gender, age and educational level. The dataset included the weights produced as 4 variables depending on which portion of the samples is being used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       Not discussed in this study                                                                                      |
| Data processing            | SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities were used process the survey in a timely manner with high outputs. Edits were performed automatically and manually at various stages of processing at macro and micro levels such as family, consistency and flow edits. Various checks were performed to ensure the consistency of data such as family relationships , respondent age against the respondent birth date. Flow edits and error detection was done on the data. The CATI and head office performed edits on the data throughout the course of interview. Quality evaluation measures were followed by statisticians prior to dissemination of data.                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                        Qualtrics got the sample from a number of panels which was identified by embedded data field that contained the respondents panel ID. Incomplete responses, duplicate responses, speeders, straight liners and  respondents whose postal code didn’t match their province were all removed from the data file.                                                                                                                                    |       During the experiment, many approaches, attacks, or near attacks on mealworms by captive G.soricina were observed. Of these, 23 met the criteria of having synchronized video and call recording that could be quantified. Examination of the video playback allowed the classification of attack types. Consumption of the mealworm by the G.soricina were also observed. Maximum detection distances of moth echoes by the bat and the bat calls by moths were also calculated. Various methods were used such as genetic analysis to assess niche flexibility, acoustic analyses to understand echolocation patterns, and behavioral experiments to observe feeding habits. This involved processing genetic samples, analyzing acoustic recordings, and interpreting behavioral data to draw conclusions about feeding behaviors and dietary preferences.                                                                                      |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc. | Imputations were made using donor records selected through a score function. Characteristics with item or partial non-response were compared with the characteristics on all donor records. When the characteristic was same for donor and recipient record, then the donor’s score increased. The donor record with the highest score was assumed the “nearest” donor and was chosen to fill in the missing information. Where donor imputation could not be sued then the mean value among a pool of donors was used. Imputation was carried out in nine detailed steps. In 2018 personal income questions were not asked in the survey and the income information was obtained from tax data of 81.9% of the respondents and for the rest of the participants, the family income information was imputed. |      Campaign period survey. During the data cleaning process, respondents were categorized based on their most important reason for removal. Duplicate responses were identified using values and were flagged if they had the same values for each of the demographic responses or the same panel ID. Post-election survey: Post-election survey responses were matched to campaign period responses by using respondent panel ID. Qualtrics and limited demographic information were also used to match additional respondents. The cleaning process was similar to campaign cleaning process with a few changes. There were no quotas for the PES so that the category doesn’t exist. Duplicate responses to the survey were identified and were removed.                                                                                                                                                                 |Not discussed in this study                                                                                              |

May bats don’t produce a faecal pellet in the short period that they are held in captivity during the duration of the study. It was difficult to determine when a bat had consumed nectar as they produced a faecal pellet but the consistency was different and no insect fragments were visible. Acoustic measurements may have biases due to variations in recording conditions or equipment limitations, which could affect the accuracy of echo-acoustic data.                                                                                      |

| Limitations, known biases  | Coverage bias as household without phone and those with telephone not covered by the current frame are excluded from the sampling frame. To the extent that the excluded population differs from the rest of the target population the results may be biased. The respondents have a choice to answer the questionnaire in English or French so speakers of other languages are at a disadvantage to take the survey so this creates a communication limitation .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |              Not discussed in the document                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |    Holding time of the bats was limiting by permitting requirements as not all bats produce faecal pellet in that time. Lack of faceal pellet cannot be used as evidence for nectarivory rather than insectivory. Observational biases may have influenced interpretations of behavioral experiments and field observations, potentially affecting conclusions about feeding strategies and niche flexibility.                                                                                         |
